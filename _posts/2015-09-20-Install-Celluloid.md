This is the second post about Celluloid & the basic installation of Celluloid in your project.

First of all you can install celluloid by,
{% highlight bash%}
gem install celluloid
{%endhighlight%}

---

To import `Celluloid` into your project,
{% highlight bash%}
require 'celluloid/current'
{%endhighlight%}

Once you `require 'celluloid/current'`, the imported Ruby class supports all the `Celluloid` APIs. You can use the power of `Celluloid` in your class.

---

If you want to add `Celluloid` into your GemFile
{% highlight bash%}
gem 'celluloid'
{%endhighlight%}


Cheers,
