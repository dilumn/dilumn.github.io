Few months ago I wrote a blog post about [I am converting Bitcoin blockchain to SQL](https://dilumn.github.io/bitcoin/2017/11/04/I-am-converting-Bitcoin-blockchain-to-SQL/). And gave several meet up talks about this crazy idea I had & the progress of the work.

You can find the slides here on [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/DilumNavanjana/cryptocurrency-ruby-elchapo-gem)

Here I am with the full database of transactions from the day Bitcoin started to March 2018. If you want to check how I did it look at my previous blog post on [I am converting Bitcoin blockchain to SQL](https://dilumn.github.io/bitcoin/2017/11/04/I-am-converting-Bitcoin-blockchain-to-SQL/)

### It took me more than 3 months to finish this conversion.

Yes I know the way I used to convert transactions is not the fastest way to do something like that. But I enjoyed a lot checking the progress everyday morning.

**Database size is 76.63 GB**

**236,915,620 transactions**

### Database columns
Block number <br>
Transaction hash <br>
Block hash <br>
Value (Transfered value) <br>
Created_at <br>
Sender <br>
Receiver <br>
Balance_receiver


More will come soon.

Cheers,
